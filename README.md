# Prototype-Selection-for-Nearest-Neighbor

One way to speed up nearest neighbor classification is to replace the training set by a carefully chosen subset of “prototypes”. We aim to implement such techniques to replace training data with a subset of data to both speed up the classification and achieve good accuracy on test data. The project uses MNIST dataset, which data can be found here: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/index.html
